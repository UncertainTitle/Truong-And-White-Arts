These are all the projects that were completed by William White, Lewis Truong and co. 

Ballio was our first attempt at a 3D platformer.
Legend of Zaldo was our attempt at creating an action game, with an emphasis on making a painless UI.
Metal Sphere was our attempt at creating a stealth game. Created in a team with 5 members.

These were all class projects created by amateurs.

CURRENT ISSUES: Metal Sphere for some reason is throwing errors when pulling or pushed. In both situations, it claims
  that certain file names are "too big".
